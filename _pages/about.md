I am a senior undergraduate studying **Computer Science, Earth & Planetary Sciences, and Applied Math and Statistics** at Johns Hopkins University. My academic goal is to pursue research at the intersection of environmental and computer science. I hope to **apply machine learning techniques on climate and earth system modeling problems**. 

Since January 2019, I have been working with [Dr. Benjamin Zaitchik](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin-zaitchik/) to study the coupling of **wetland and climate changes on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau** using satellite images, ground observations, and climate models. I have also worked with [Dr. Katalin Szlavecz](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/katalin-szlavecz/) and [Dr. Alex Szalay](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/alexander-s-szalay/) to develop a **user-friendly wireless sensor platform** for collecting in-situ measurements of soil temperature and moisture. 

During the summers of 2018 and 2019, I worked as a research intern for **Nyanpo Yutse Conservation Association** to help Tibetan conservationists to survey alpine grasslands biodiversity and endangered plant species. I have also collaborated with a group of Chinese conservationists to conduct an interdisciplinary study on **illegal wildlife trade in China**.

I am currently applying to **PhD programs** in earth and environmental science, and I would love to learn about the opportunites in the field of atmospheric and climate science. On this website you can find my CV, publication, and contact information. I appreciate your time of exploring this website. In you have any questions, I would be more than happy to discuss with you.
