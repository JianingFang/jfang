I am a third-year [PhD candidate](https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people/jianing-fang) at Columbia University advised by [Prof. Pierre Gentine](https://www.eee.columbia.edu/faculty/pierre-gentine). My current research focuses on combining process-based land models and machine learning to learn unknown functional relationships in terrestiral biosphere processes. I am also interested in using solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) to better understand photosynthesis and vegetation dynamics. My previous projectes include developing a (long-term reconstruction)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14987] of global SIF at 0.05 degree resolution from 1982-2021, and using the (diurnal variations of SIF)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.16683] as an early signal of vegetation drought in the US Southwest.

Prior to joining Prof. Gentine's lab, I graduated in May 2021 from the Johns Hopkins University with a BS degree in Computer Science, Earth & Planetary Sciences, and Applied Math and Statistics (GPA 3.96). During myhis undergraduate studies, I worked with Prof. Benjamin Zaitchik to apply remote sensing and in-situ observations to study the (climate drivers)[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/8/1484] of wetland change on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. I also led the development, testing, and deployment of a (wireless sensor network)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10260] for soil moisture monitoring under the supervision of Prof. Katalin Szlavecz and Prof. Alex Szalay.
