excerpt: 'The coupling of rapid warming and wetland degradation on the Tibetan Plateau has motivated studies of climate influence on wetland change in the region. These studies typically examine large, topographically homogeneous regions, whereas conservation efforts sometimes require fine-grained information in rugged terrain. This study addresses topographically constrained wetlands on the Eastern Tibetan, where herders report significant wetland degradation. We used Landsat images to examine changes in wetland areas and Sentinel-1 SAR images to investigate water level and vegetation structure. We also analyzed trends in precipitation, growing season length, and reference evapotranspiration in weather station records. Snow cover and the vegetation growing season were quantified using MODIS observations. We analyzed estimates of actual evapotranspiration using the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model (ALEXI) and the Simplified Surface Energy Balance model (SSEBop). Satellite-informed analyses failed to confirm herdersâ€™ accounts of reduced wetland function, as no coherent trends were found in wetland area, water content, or vegetation structure. An analysis of meteorological records did indicate a warming-induced increase in reference evapotranspiration, and both meteorological records and satellites suggest that the growing season had lengthened, potentially increasing water demand and driving wetland change. The discrepancies between the satellite data and local observations pointed to temporal, spatial, and epistemological gaps in combining scientific data with empirical evidence in understanding wetland change on the Tibetan Plateau.'
